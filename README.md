## Technologies, Approaches, Fails and Wins

### Tech & Approaches
* Bootstrap
  * I used Bootstrap for this project. I've worked with it in the past but
* Custom css
  * I used a lot of my own CSS but I feel it could have been better
* Partials
  * I love the idea of partials but there were some problems I ran into like not being able to use an active class for the nav links.
* Graphics
  * I made my own graphics with photoshop


### Struggles



### Failed Attempts
* Timestamp date formating
  * I was just really confused on where to put what. I tried for a really long time but just couldn't find where everything needed to be.
* Radio
  * I tried for awhile to get the radio selection correct during editing
* Photo upload
  * I wanted the user to be able to upload a photo but it didn't take long before I decided I wasn't ready for that

### Wins!

* I was able to debug database issues on my own
* I enjoyed making this!

### Thoughts and Notes

* I feel like I held back a little because I was afraid one thing can throw something out of wack. I'm still not confident enough with my JavaScript to get super adventurous.
